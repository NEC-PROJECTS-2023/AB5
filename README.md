DESCRIPTION :

As the amounts of online books are exponentially increasing due to COVID-19 pandemic,
finding relevant books from a vast e-book space becomes a tremendous challenge for online
users. Personal recommendation systems have been emerged to conduct effective search which
mine related books based on user rating and interest.Most of these existing systems are user-based ratings where content-based and collaborative
learning methods are used. This system proposed an effective system for recommending books
for online users that rated a book using the clustering method and then found a similarity of
that book to suggest a new book.
